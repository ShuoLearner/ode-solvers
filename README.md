This is a repository which contains several numerical Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solvers, in terms of C++, that will be used by COPASI with Event Handling Function. This repository may include ode solvers based on both Runge--Kutta (RK) Method (One Step Method) and Multistep Method.

For the RK method, explicit and implicit methods are considered. Explicit method like ode23 and ode45 are the first to be developed. Radau5 or some other low order implicit methods are the next to be concentrated. 

For the Multistep methods, such as Adams method and BDF method are considered in the future.
